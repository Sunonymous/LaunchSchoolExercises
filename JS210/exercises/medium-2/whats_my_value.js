// What's My Value?

// Setting the 3.4th "index" of array simply creates the value 'Oranges' at a key '3.5'
//   This does not count as a valid index and therefore not towards the length of the array.
// The first time the length is logged, it will be 3.
// The length of the keys of the array object will be 4.

// Same with setting the index of -2.
// array.length is still 3.
// Keys are now 5.

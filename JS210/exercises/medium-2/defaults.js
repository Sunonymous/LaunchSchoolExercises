// Defaults

// short circuit operators return the value of the last operand evaluated.
// in the second examples, this causes invalid inputs to be returned/used,
//   even if they are not appropriate
// for example, if '5' was passed in for the discount (maybe it was not cast)
//   JS would use that instead of setting it to the proper default

// Hmm... after reading the solution, I guess the question was more concerning
//   the omission of arguments rather than the truthiness of unexpected types.
// I do understand the concept, however.

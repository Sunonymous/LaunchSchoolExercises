// Mutation

// so first we push all the elements from array1 into array2
// then we iterate over array1 and replace 'Curly' with 'CURLY' and 'Chico' with 'CHICO'
// but because primitive values are immutable, array2 is cool and unfazed.

// if an object literal was included, then changes to the object would reflect in both arrays
// to make the changes show in both arrays, surround all the names within a nested array

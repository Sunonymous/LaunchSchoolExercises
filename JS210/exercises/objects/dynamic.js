// Dynamic

// assigning an object literal to a constant variable myObject
// assigning '456' to constant variable prop2
// reassigning the 'prop2' property of myObject to '456'
// assigning '678' to a new property in myObject at '456'
// first logged  is 678
// second logged is 456


// further exploration
// should log 'hello, world!'
// because the function is being invoked in the bracket notation to access the property.
// the function returns 'funcProp' in both cases, and the value is reassigned between the log lines

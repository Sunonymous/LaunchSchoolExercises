// Heh, wonder who wrote this exercise... actually just because his name is there doesn't indicate that he wrote it.
// I wonder if LS faculty leave little signatures like that. There have been other names. Are they signatures or do they tag each other??
// Re: the exercise, I see that they are accessing the object properties which have function values, yet they are not invoking the functions.
// So whatever it is, there should be a string representation of the functions, no?
// Yeah, that's basically what it was.

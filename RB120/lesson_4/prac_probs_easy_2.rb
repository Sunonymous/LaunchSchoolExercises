# Practice Problems Easy 2

# 1.    The predict the future method will combine its two strings and return it.
#       Nothing is output because there is no call to do so.
# 2.    The RoadTrip class choices method overrides the Oracle's version, so it
#       replaces the options from the previous question, though the function is the same.
# 3.    Follow the method lookup path: class itself, modules from last-entered to
#       first, then super-classes all the way up. Use Class#ancestors to find the chain.
#       Orange, Taste, Object, Kernel, BasicObject -- HotSauce is the same with HotSauce instead of Orange.
# 4.    attr_accessor :type
# 5.    In the order given, local variable, instance variable, and class variable.
#       Local variables have no prefix, instance are prefixed with @, class with @@.
# 6.    Self.manufacturer is the class method because it starts with self. Called
#       directly from the class itself.
# 7.    The cats_count class variable tracks the number of Cat objects which have
#       been initialized. In the constructor it is incremented by one, and the variable
#       is shared by all instances of the class.
#       You could invoke the method from the class itself to access the variable.
# 8.    Bingo simply needs to inherit from the Game class. Suffix the class name with `< Game`.
# 9.    Because Ruby looks in the immediate class for methods first, the method
#       inside the Bingo class effectively overrides the method in the game class,
#       so the latter will not run.
# 10.   Object Oriented Programming has the benefit of organizing your code into
#       easier to manage groups, it emulates a logic of categorization that can
#       be understood a little more naturally by many people. It also allows for 
#       a greater flexibility in the code through polymorphism, in the sense that
#       the code can implement common interfaces, and each object using the interface
#       can have its own implementation in place. Another benefit is encapsulation,
#       this idea that not all of the codebase should have access to other components.
#       This increases the security and integrity of the code by preventing interference
#       among components.

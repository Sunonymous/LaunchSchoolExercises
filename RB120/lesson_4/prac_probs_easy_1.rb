# Practice Problems Easy 1

# 1. All are objects, found with obj#class method.
# 2. Include the Speed module and invoke its go_fast method.
# 3. We're using the self keyword to reference the calling object, and invoking
#    the class method to output its class name (which is cast to a string).
# 4. Use the Class#new method to call the constructor.
# 5. Instance variables are prefixed with a @
# 6. Add an attribute reader or manually create a method to return the instance variable.
# 7. Default return value is a string containing the object name and a representation
#    of its object_id, along with any initialized instance variables. Check in irb.
# 8. In this case, self refers to the object instance which invoked the method.
# 9. In this case, self refers to the Cat class itself, used to invoke a class method.
# 10.Call Bag.new('color_of_bag', 'bag_material')
